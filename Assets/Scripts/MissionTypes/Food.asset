  - "\u201CHonorable manager, I\u2019m pleased to meet you. I\u2019m Elise, responsible
    for the food and water reports. Even though we probably won\u2019t be meeting
    each other formally, I hope we can work together remotely, and I pray for our
    success in these treacherous times.\r\nDue to the recent drought, the community
    living near Q15 is suffering from a food shortage that can soon become unquestionably
    dangerous, and thus I ask for a delivery to the site with swiftness so the people
    can last until the next harvest.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonorable manager, there\u2019s a big concentration of people living in
    the slums next to the city in R29 who are in dire need of sustenance. Their children
    can barely fully develop, and the ones that do, die young due to starvation.
    Please deliver the named food to the area before another generation succumbs
    due to the lack of it.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonorable manager, thanks to last week\u2019s fire, R98 is on the brink
    of collapse. Many people lost their homes, and thankfully, there weren\u2019t
    that many casualties, but what is really affecting the city significantly is
    the lack of nutrition. Most of their food supply has literally disintegrated
    from the face of the earth, all because of the extreme temperatures of this dreadful
    summer. If this continues, I fear there will be many more losses. \r\nRespectfully
    submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonorable manager, the community close to B63 had their crops ruthlessly
    burned, and now they do not have enough to survive the cold months. Please provide
    them with the enumerated resources before they all starve to death.\r\nLegally,
    I can still keep possession of a firearm, but I know I mustn\u2019t, so I can
    only pray that those filthy aggressors get where they deserve in this or the
    next life, which will be a long one filled with pain and fire.\r\nRespectfully
    submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonourable manager, I do not know if your time in the team was been a
    pleasant one or not, I have my reasons to believe it was not, as mine wasn\u2019t
    either. I see two paths ahead of me, two paths where my destiny can lead, and
    it\u2019s up to me to decide what it will be, or not. I can just continue on
    this game of waiting until God decides for me. Will keep you updated on which
    path I decided to take, but for now, I have work for you:\r\nIt seems that someone
    cut off the water to all the populations near D56 site, the people are in the
    brink of insanity right now, and, to make the situation even better someone had
    teh brilliant idea that this time os crisis was their calling to raise their
    (already too great for their own good) wealth. This\u2026 parasite has possession
    of everything water-based in the site, and now it's selling it at absurd prices
    to an already poor population.\r\nHow I wish I could just\u2026 Well, what we
    can do is have you deliver a steady water supply to the border of these populations
    and distribute them as we can until the specialized team can fix the water supply,
    but until then, I\u2019ll pray, and for what is only between me and god.\r\nRespectfully
    submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
