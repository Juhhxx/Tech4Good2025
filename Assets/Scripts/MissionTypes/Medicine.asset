  - "You probably do not know me at all or have only heard briefly about me, but
    I\u2019m Adrien, the one responsible for the reports of the resources and medical
    sectors. I\u2019ll be giving the reports for all the resources and medical related
    missions from here on out. I hope we can get along and that your time with us
    is\u2026 Well, I can\u2019t say pleasurable, but at least manageable and, hopefully,
    successful. I\u2019m counting on you, manager.\r\n\r\nThere's an isolated village
    in G23 that has some alarming cases of the flu. Please send a team with the requested
    medicines so our team can get that taken care of.\n\r\nMy best regards,\r\nAdrien"
  - "We need a delivery of medical supplies to site W11, the location was raided,
    and a lot of their homes were broken into and destroyed. It was something hate-based,
    so they didn\u2019t take much, but there were some injuries to those who tried
    to stop the attackers. They didn\u2019t have much medicine to begin with, but
    what they had is almost running out, and we will need more if we want to treat
    everybody.\r\nI\u2019m not much of a fighter myself, but if I saw a bunch of
    armed people attacking my home and destroying my livelihood, I don\u2019t think
    I could keep still, so I understand why they would fight back against that armed
    group, even if they were unarmed themselves.\n\r\nMy best regards,\r\nAdrien"
  - "There was a landslide on site U16, and it led to some injuries ranging from
    light to severe. Please deliver the medical supplies to the site as fast as you
    can. Most of the injured were children, they are stable now, but I don\u2019t
    know how long they\u2019ll last without the right treatment. I\u2019ll do the
    best I can with what I've got since I do have medical training, but I can only
    do so much, so please, we really need those supplies and fast.\r\nMy best regards,\r\nAdrien"
  - 'A bridge on site E54 collapsed due to heavy rain, so we need these supplies
    to rebuild and resume safe passage from the village in E53 and the river in E55.
    Please deliver these before the location''s water supply runs out, the team will
    be waiting.

    

    My best regards,

    Adrien'
  - "I hope your time in the team hasn\u2019t been too stressful so far. I know how
    it can be\u2026 my wife was in your position for a decade, you know, but after
    a year she had to be discharged due to mental health problems, the stress and
    too much, and it still affects her today. She doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m
    still an active field agent, but I think this is my true purpose, begging here,
    around people, helping\u2026 sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this so
    strongly. My daughter resents me, she resents me for not being there for her,
    and she makes that clear whenever she responds to my letters (which is barely),
    but I don\u2019t blame her, I understand, I really do, but\u2026 I can\u2019t
    ignore what I feel I was born to do! She\u2019s young, maybe one day, when she
    is older, she will understand, and maybe, just maybe, she will be proud of having
    me as a father. When she was young, she used to say I was just like a superhero
    heh\u2026 I miss her, I miss my home, I miss my wife, I\u2019ll think about that
    honor dispatch the commander sent me a few weeks ago."
