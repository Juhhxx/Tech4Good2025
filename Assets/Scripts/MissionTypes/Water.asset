  - "Honorable manager, I\u2019m pleased to meet you. I\u2019m Elise, responsible
    for the food and water reports. Even though we probably won\u2019t be meeting
    each other formally, I hope we can work together remotely, and I pray for our
    success in these treacherous times.\r\nThe well of the village on site U18 has
    been completely blocked off after a sandstorm and thus I kindly ask for you to
    deliver the required supplies to the location with swiftness.\r\nRespectfully
    submitted,\r\nElise"
  - "Honorable manager, there was an attack on site V12, more specifically on their
    main water supply. The base has the resources to undo the damage, but it will
    take a while, and they do not have enough water for themselves to survive the
    rebuilding process without help. I ask you to be quick.\r\nAs a former member
    of an armed force, I always frowned upon initiatives of this kind. May god forgive
    them. \r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nElise"
  - "\u201CHonorable manager, due to human \u201Cerror\u201D (allegedly) and a vast
    quantity of toxic waste that was disposed in the river where the community of
    C1 gets their drinking water from, said water is now dangerous for consumption
    and thus the community will have to wait for the river to renovate itself before
    they have a steady supply of drinking water once again. In the meantime, it will
    need a supply of water for the people to survive during this time, so that's
    what I ask of you this time.\r\nSometimes I wish I could eliminate these kinds
    of problems by the source, but that's between them and God, I wish these people
    a very fiery stay in hell.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonorable manager, the well from which the community of T6 went to get
    their water from was destroyed. That was their only source of water for miles.
    Please make a swift delivery of drinking water to them while the well is restored.\r\nShould
    I do something? I\u2019m older but now I have way more contacts than before.
    My injury does not let me re enter the army but I can still fight for sure. May
    god have mercy upon those whose souls cross my path in the next few hours because
    I do not wish to converse with others for the time being.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonourable manager, I do not know if your time in the team has been a
    pleasant one or not, I have my reasons to believe it was not, as mine wasn\u2019t
    either. I see two paths ahead of me, two paths where my destiny can lead, and
    it\u2019s up to me to decide what it will be, or not. I can just continue on
    this game of waiting until God decides for me. Will keep you updated on which
    path I decided to take, but for now, I have work for you:\r\nSomeone sabotaged
    the city's close to M4 generators, as a result, all machines used to keep the
    stored food from spoiling have stopped working. A lot of food went bad in the
    process, people started to get desperate, and, unfortunately, there is not enough
    non-perishable food for everyone. This can lead to serious affliction inside
    the city because, as you may know, when people are hungry and desperate, they
    get aggressive. See that the supply arrives at the site shortly before any real
    damage is done.\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nElise\u201D"
