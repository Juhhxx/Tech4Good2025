  Texts:
  - "You probably do not know me at all or have only heard briefly about me, but
    I\u2019m Adrien, the one responsible for the reports of the resources and medical
    sectors. I\u2019ll be giving the reports for all the resources and medical related
    missions from here on out. I hope we can get along and that your time with us
    is\u2026 Well, I can\u2019t say pleasurable, but at least manageable and, hopefully,
    successful. I\u2019m counting on you, manager.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a school that
    needs to be built in F26, please forward the following resources to our location.\r\nMy
    best regards,\r\nAdrien"
  - 'I hope this letter finds you swiftly. There was a deadly flood at site R13.
    We desperately need these resources as soon as possible, or we can lose an important
    base and that would make our movements much slower, which could mean a lot more
    people without support. Please do what you can, manager.

    

    My best
    regards,

    Adrien'
  - "I hope this letter finds you well. We\u2019re in dire need of these supplies
    in U16 due to an unexpected landslide that buried some houses under rubble. Please
    deliver the required resources swiftly, so that these people can have their place
    to stay long-term and continue living their lives.\n\r\nMy best regards,\r\nAdrien"
  - 'A bridge on site E54 collapsed due to heavy rain, so we need these supplies
    to rebuild and resume safe passage from the village in E53 and the river in E55.
    Please deliver these before the location''s water supply runs out, the team will
    be waiting.

    

    My best regards,

    Adrien'
  - "I hope your time in the team hasn\u2019t been too stressful so far. I know how
    it can be\u2026 my wife was in your position for a decade, you know, but after
    a year she had to be discharged due to mental health problems, the stress and
    too much, and it still affects her today. She doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m
    still an active field agent, but I think this is my true purpose, begging here,
    around people, helping\u2026 sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this so
    strongly. My daughter resents me, she resents me for not being there for her,
    and she makes that clear whenever she responds to my letters (which is barely),
    but I don\u2019t blame her, I understand, I really do, but\u2026 I can\u2019t
    ignore what I feel I was born to do! She\u2019s young, maybe one day, when she
    is older, she will understand, and maybe, just maybe, she will be proud of having
    me as a father. When she was young, she used to say I was just like a superhero
    heh\u2026 I miss her, I miss my home, I miss my wife, I\u2019ll think about that
    honor dispatch the commander sent me a few weeks ago.\n\n"
